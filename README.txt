## A text adventure game

This project is a text adventure game created over a semester in Intro to Software Development at Marist College. 

The game utilizes several key facets of web development:
* Javascript/ECMAScript
* jQuery
* HTML5
    * Validated by W3
* CSS

Suggestions are always welcome and I am interested in making this game as efficient as possible.
